This is the first entry in my developer diary. This diary will be kept to keep track
of the development of The Lost Knight. All code will be published here on this
Github repository. So far, I have a basic player and some platforms. I can move the
player using touch buttons which I have placed on the bottom of the screen.

The player can also shoot using a script which I wrote for my previous game 'Hattori' which I had already started on before being assigned this game.
I also spent a considerable amount of time working on the movement aspects of my first Unity game 'Zephyr'. I hope that I am able to successfully use some of these scripts such as moving platforms and more advanced player movement such as ascending slopes, being able to stick to walls and being able to jump from walls. 

My plan for today is try and implement these movement features from Zephyr into The Lost Knight and to also get a nice camera movement system for following the player.

Yesterday I tried to implement the movement features from Zephyr into The Lost Knight. However, I realized it would take a large amount of work to refactor everything to work with The Lost Knight and I realized that a lot of it wasn't really necesasry. While Zephyr's main focus was on the movement aspect of the game, I don't feel like this is necessary to implement into The Lost Knight. Thing's like moving platforms and wall jumping/wall sliding don't really have a place in a 2D Action game and it also wasn't specified in the design document so I have chosen to exclude these features and focus instead on other aspects of the design.

I did however manage to implement some nice camera movement into The Lost Knight with a simple one line script. It has a nice smoothing effect which can be adjusted and I am happy with it.

Today I hope to be able to make a sprite so I can start work on melee attacking and and animations for attacking and dashing as these are core gameplay mechanics and should be started on sooner rather than later.
