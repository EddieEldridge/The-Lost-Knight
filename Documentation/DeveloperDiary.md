## 7th October, 2018
This is the first entry in my developer diary. This diary will be kept to keep track
of the development of The Lost Knight. All code will be published here on this
Github repository. So far, I have a basic player and some platforms. I can move the
player using touch buttons which I have placed on the bottom of the screen.

The player can also shoot using a script which I wrote for my previous game 'Hattori' which I had already started on before being assigned this game.
I also spent a considerable amount of time working on the movement aspects of my first Unity game 'Zephyr'. I hope that I am able to successfully use some of these scripts such as moving platforms and more advanced player movement such as ascending slopes, being able to stick to walls and being able to jump from walls. 

My plan for today is try and implement these movement features from Zephyr into The Lost Knight and to also get a nice camera movement system for following the player.
